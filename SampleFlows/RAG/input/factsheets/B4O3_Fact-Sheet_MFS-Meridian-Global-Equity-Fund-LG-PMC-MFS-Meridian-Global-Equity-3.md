Roger joined MFS in 2002 as a research analyst and was named portfolio manager for the Global Equity strategy in 2009. Ryan joined MFS in 2007 as a research analyst and was named portfolio manager for the Global Equity strategy in 2016.

Sanjay Natarajan joined MFS in 2007 and was named institutional portfolio manager for the Global Equity strategy in 2008. Victoria Higley joined MFS and the Global Equity team in 2011. Chris Sunderland joined MFS and the Global Equity team in 2015.

In managing Global Equity portfolios, the team has the benefit of drawing on the entire investment resources of the firm, including the global research analyst team and other portfolio managers. While additional core equity team members Kevin Beatty, Filipe Benzinho, Daniel Ling, Ted Maloney and Alison O'Neil Mackey, and do not make buy and sell decisions for the Global Equity portfolios, they actively contribute by interacting with the Global Equity team with respect to new ideas and investment discussions, which complement the more structured idea generation from the global research analyst team.

## FUND SPECIFIC RISKS

- ·  The fund invests in equities (shares of companies), so there is a higher risk of the fund's value being volatile (i.e. going up and down) than with a fund which invests in most other asset types, particularly in the short term.
- ·  The Fund may hold assets in currencies that are not denominated in sterling. If the value of these currencies falls compared to sterling this may cause the Fund's value to go down. Some Funds may employ currency hedging as a means of protecting the Fund's value against currency movements. In extreme market conditions, the hedge may not be perfect and the Fund may be exposed to currency changes.
- ·  The Fund may undertake derivative transactions as part of efficient portfolio management ('EPM') or reduction in investment risk in line with the Historic FCA Permitted Links rules
- ·  The fund invests in emerging markets where there may be limited information available publicly to investors. In general, emerging market issuers are not subject to accounting, auditing and financial standards and requirements similar to those required of developed market issuers. Also, local laws may prevent the repatriation of capital or profit from those countries into the UK. In addition, the stock markets and currencies of emerging markets can be volatile, due to the fact that the political and economic systems in these countries are still developing. In such cases delays in settlement may cause the fund to have exposure to a third party broker or counterparty. This may result in a greater risk that the value of the fund might go down. The investments in these markets might also be bought and sold infrequently therefore resulting in large changes in their prices.
- ·  The fund manager may lend stock to other parties and it is usual for the borrower to provide collateral. If the borrower fails to return the borrowed stock, the collateral may not be enough to cover the value of the stock, resulting in a reduction in the fund value.
- ·  The fund should be utilised as part of a diversified investment strategy within a wider portfolio of funds. These funds are not designed to be solely invested in.
- ·  This fund is able to delay paying out, which may mean that you have to wait to get your money. A delay may happen when market conditions mean it is difficult for the fund manager to cash in investments to pay out to investors. For example, a fund with investments in commercial properties may find they may take time to sell. Whilst waiting to complete on the sale of properties, the fund manager may suspend making payments to investors who want to cash in. The fund can only delay paying out if it is in the interests of all investors.
