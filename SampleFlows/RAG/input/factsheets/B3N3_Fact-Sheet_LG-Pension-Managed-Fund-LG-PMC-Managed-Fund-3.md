## RISK AND REWARD PROFILE

## FUND AIM

To seek steady long-term growth, whilst at the same time safeguarding the fund against excessive risks. It invests mainly in UK and international shares, but also has some exposure to fixed interest securities, UK commercial property and cash, thereby offering a more diversified investment than a pure equity fund.

## FUND FACTS

<!-- image -->

Investment funds with a lower risk profile typically exhibit fewer price fluctuations and therefore a lower probability of temporary capital losses. Funds with a high risk rating typically experience greater fluctuations in value and maintain a greater risk of capital losses.

Performance data source: Lipper. Returns are calculated on the basis of daily midday dealing prices, those at which you transact. Other fact sheets may show returns on a different basis, e.g. daily midday mid-market prices. Fund performance is shown net, which is after the deduction of the fund management charge.

The fund performance does not take account of any product charges applicable to your scheme. You can find more information about our charges in the terms and conditions booklet (for example, the Member's Booklet and Member's Policy Booklet) or Key Features documents.

Past performance is not a guide to the future. The value of an investment is not guaranteed and can go down as well as up. Exchange rate variations can cause the value of overseas investments to increase or decrease. You may not get back the amount you originally invested. For overseas markets the figures are sterling adjusted and net of any withholding tax.

Important: a fund switch affecting this fund occurred in the past - see page 3 for details

## NICOLA MORGAN-BROWNSELL

Nicola is a Fund Manager in the MultiAsset Funds team. Prior to this, Nicola worked at HSBC Asset Management, overseeing front office investment risk across the equity businesses globally, and in the Multi-Asset team at BNP Paribas IP as both a portfolio and investment risk manager.

*Exposure through shares in listed infrastructure and global Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). Asset allocations are subject to change.

## FUND SPECIFIC RISKS

- ·  The fund invests in equities (shares of companies), so there is a higher risk of the fund's value being volatile (i.e. going up and down) than with a fund which invests in most other asset types, particularly in the short term.
- ·  Investment returns on fixed interest securities, such as corporate and government bonds, are particularly sensitive to trends in interest rate movements and inflation. Their values are likely to fall when interest rates rise. Such falls may be more pronounced in a low, or negative interest rate environment and longer dated fixed interest securities will fall by more than short dated fixed interest securities.
- ·  The fund invests in fixed interest securities. The financial strength of a company or government issuing the security determines their ability to make some or all of the payments due. If this financial strength weakens, the chances of them not making payments increases and this will reduce the Fund's value.
- ·  The Fund may hold assets in currencies that are not denominated in sterling. If the value of these currencies falls compared to sterling this may cause the Fund's value to go down. Some Funds may employ currency hedging as a means of protecting the Fund's value against currency movements. In extreme market conditions, the hedge may not be perfect and the Fund may be exposed to currency changes.
- ·  The Fund may undertake derivative transactions in line with the FCA Conduct of Business rules (COBS 21). The Fund may invest in other collective investment schemes, which use derivatives for investment purposes as opposed to solely for efficient portfolio management or reduction in investment risk.
- ·  The Fund may hold Over the Counter ('OTC') derivative contracts with banks or other financial institutions. If these organisations experience financial difficulty, they may be unable to pay back the sums that they owe under the OTC derivative contracts. If this happens, the value of the investment will fall.
- ·  The fund manager may lend stock to other parties and it is usual for the borrower to provide collateral. If the borrower fails to return the borrowed stock, the collateral may not be enough to cover the value of the stock, resulting in a reduction in the fund value.
- ·  This fund is able to delay paying out, which may mean that you have to wait to get your money. A delay may happen when market conditions mean it is difficult for the fund manager to cash in investments to pay out to investors. For example, a fund with investments in commercial properties may find they may take time to sell. Whilst waiting to complete on the sale of properties, the fund manager may suspend making payments to investors who want to cash in. The fund can only delay paying out if it is in the interests of all investors.
