Performance data source: Lipper. Returns are calculated on the basis of daily midday dealing

prices, those at which you transact. Other fact sheets may show returns on a different basis, e.g. daily midday mid-market prices. Fund performance is shown net, which is after the deduction of the fund management charge.

The fund performance does not take account of any product charges applicable to your scheme. You can find more information about our charges in the terms and conditions booklet (for example, the Member's Booklet and Member's Policy Booklet) or Key Features documents.

Past performance is not a guide to the future. The value of an investment is not guaranteed and can go down as well as up. Exchange rate variations can cause the value of overseas investments to increase or decrease. You may not get back the amount you originally invested. For overseas markets the figures are sterling adjusted and net of any withholding tax.

## INDEX & SYSTEMATIC EQUITY PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT TEAM

The Index & Systematic Equity Portfolio Management team is made up of experienced investment professionals who are responsible for developing and managing our equity index tracker strategies.

The team is led by Joseph Molloy, Head of Index & Systematic Equity Portfolio Management. Joseph Molloy joined HSBC in early 2015 from Legal and General Investment Management where he was Head of Passive Equities. Joseph is based in London and reports to Vis Nayar, Deputy Chief Investment Officer for Equities. Joseph has over 20 years of industry experience and we believe both his experience and expertise are invaluable in helping us to consolidate and grow our passive equity investment management capability.

The Index & Systematic Equity Portfolio Management team operates in a collegiate manner sharing responsibility for the portfolios within the team. Each fund managed by the Index & Systematic Equity Portfolio Management team has a primary, deputy and training portfolio manager, of which the primary and deputy portfolio manager are jointly responsible for the performance of the fund. The day-to-day management of the fund is the responsibility of the primary portfolio manager and in his absence, of the deputy. Day-to-day portfolio management involves monitoring of the portfolio against the benchmark index, management of cash-flows (including accruals) and corporate actions, as well as implementation of index changes.

## FUND SPECIFIC RISKS

- ·  The fund invests in equities (shares of companies), so there is a higher risk of the fund's value being volatile (i.e. going up and down) than with a fund which invests in most other asset types, particularly in the short term.
- ·  The Fund may hold assets in currencies that are not denominated in sterling. If the value of these currencies falls compared to sterling this may cause the Fund's value to go down. Some Funds may employ currency hedging as a means of protecting the Fund's value against currency movements. In extreme market conditions, the hedge may not be perfect and the Fund may be exposed to currency changes.
- ·  The fund invests in emerging markets where there may be limited information available publicly to investors. In general, emerging market issuers are not subject to accounting, auditing and financial standards and requirements similar to those required of developed market issuers. Also, local laws may prevent the repatriation of capital or profit from those countries into the UK. In addition, the stock markets and currencies of emerging markets can be volatile, due to the fact that the political and economic systems in these countries are still developing. In such cases delays in settlement may cause the fund to have exposure to a third party broker or counterparty. This may result in a greater risk that the value of the fund might go down. The investments in these markets might also be bought and sold infrequently therefore resulting in large changes in their prices.
- ·  The fund invests in companies from a particular market sector (such as financial companies or oil companies) which means that there is a higher level of risk because the fund's investments are not diversified across a variety of market sectors. As a result, the value of an investment in this fund may go up and down more often and by larger amounts than funds that invest in a wider range of market sectors, particularly in the short term.
- ·  The fund should be utilised as part of a diversified investment strategy within a wider portfolio of funds. These funds are not designed to be solely invested in.
- ·  This fund is able to delay paying out, which may mean that you have to wait to get your money. A delay may happen when market conditions mean it is difficult for the fund manager to cash in investments to pay out to investors. For example, a fund with investments in commercial properties may find they may take time to sell. Whilst waiting to complete on the sale of properties, the fund manager may suspend making payments to investors who want to cash in. The fund can only delay paying out if it is in the interests of all investors.
