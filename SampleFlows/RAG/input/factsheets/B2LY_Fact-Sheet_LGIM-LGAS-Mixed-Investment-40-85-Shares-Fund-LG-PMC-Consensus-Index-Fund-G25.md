Performance data source: Lipper. Returns are calculated on the basis of daily midday dealing prices, those at which you transact. Other fact sheets may show returns on a different basis, e.g. daily midday mid-market prices. Fund performance is shown net, which is after the deduction of the fund management charge.

The fund performance does not take account of any product charges applicable to your scheme. You can find more information about our charges in the terms and conditions booklet (for example, the Member's Booklet and Member's Policy Booklet) or Key Features documents.

Past performance is not a guide to the future. The value of an investment is not guaranteed and can go down as well as up. Exchange rate variations can cause the value of overseas investments to increase or decrease. You may not get back the amount you originally invested. For overseas markets the figures are sterling adjusted and net of any withholding tax.

## FUND SPECIFIC RISKS

- ·  The fund invests in equities (shares of companies), so there is a higher risk of the fund's value being volatile (i.e. going up and down) than with a fund which invests in most other asset types, particularly in the short term.
- ·  Investment returns on fixed interest securities, such as corporate and government bonds, are particularly sensitive to trends in interest rate movements and inflation. Their values are likely to fall when interest rates rise. Such falls may be more pronounced in a low, or negative interest rate environment and longer dated fixed interest securities will fall by more than short dated fixed interest securities.
- ·  The fund invests in fixed interest securities. The financial strength of a company or government issuing the security determines their ability to make some or all of the payments due. If this financial strength weakens, the chances of them not making payments increases and this will reduce the Fund's value.
- ·  The Fund may hold assets in currencies that are not denominated in sterling. If the value of these currencies falls compared to sterling this may cause the Fund's value to go down. Some Funds may employ currency hedging as a means of protecting the Fund's value against currency movements. In extreme market conditions, the hedge may not be perfect and the Fund may be exposed to currency changes.
- ·  The Fund may undertake derivative transactions as part of efficient portfolio management ('EPM') or reduction in investment risk in line with the Historic FCA Permitted Links rules
- ·  The fund manager may lend stock to other parties and it is usual for the borrower to provide collateral. If the borrower fails to return the borrowed stock, the collateral may not be enough to cover the value of the stock, resulting in a reduction in the fund value.
- ·  This fund is able to delay paying out, which may mean that you have to wait to get your money. A delay may happen when market conditions mean it is difficult for the fund manager to cash in investments to pay out to investors. For example, a fund with investments in commercial properties may find they may take time to sell. Whilst waiting to complete on the sale of properties, the fund manager may suspend making payments to investors who want to cash in. The fund can only delay paying out if it is in the interests of all investors.

'Spreads' reflect the underlying costs of buying and selling assets in a fund and are included in the daily unit price so will not be shown as a separate charge on your statements. The spread shown aims to provide an indication of potential spreads incurred when transacting in this fund, but what you pay will vary from this. You can find more information on transaction costs here.

In exceptional market conditions spreads may widen considerably and be subject to frequent change, so what you pay may be significantly different and higher from normal market conditions.
