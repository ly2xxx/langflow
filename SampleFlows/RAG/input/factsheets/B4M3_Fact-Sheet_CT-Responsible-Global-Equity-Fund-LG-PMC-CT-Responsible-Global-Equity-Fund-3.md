Performance data source: Lipper. Returns are calculated on the basis of daily midday dealing prices, those at which you transact. Other fact sheets may show returns on a different basis, e.g. daily midday mid-market prices. Fund performance is shown net, which is after the deduction of the fund management charge.

The fund performance does not take account of any product charges applicable to your scheme. You can find more information about our charges in the terms and conditions booklet (for example, the Member's Booklet and Member's Policy Booklet) or Key Features documents.

Past performance is not a guide to the future. The value of an investment is not guaranteed and can go down as well as up. Exchange rate variations can cause the value of overseas investments to increase or decrease. You may not get back the amount you originally invested. For overseas markets the figures are sterling adjusted and net of any withholding tax.

Important: a fund switch affecting this fund occurred in the past - see page 3 for details

The fund's risk rating is based on the historic volatility of the fund's value and it may change in the future.

Investment funds with a lower risk profile typically exhibit fewer price fluctuations and therefore a lower probability of temporary capital losses. Funds with a high risk rating typically experience greater fluctuations in value and maintain a greater risk of capital losses.

For more information on the investment risks that are specific to this fund, please refer to the Fund Specific Risks section on page 3.

## FUND SPECIFIC RISKS

- ·  The fund invests in equities (shares of companies), so there is a higher risk of the fund's value being volatile (i.e. going up and down) than with a fund which invests in most other asset types, particularly in the short term.
- ·  The Fund may hold assets in currencies that are not denominated in sterling. If the value of these currencies falls compared to sterling this may cause the Fund's value to go down. Some Funds may employ currency hedging as a means of protecting the Fund's value against currency movements. In extreme market conditions, the hedge may not be perfect and the Fund may be exposed to currency changes.
- ·  The Fund may undertake derivative transactions as part of efficient portfolio management ('EPM') or reduction in investment risk in line with the Historic FCA Permitted Links rules
- ·  The Fund may hold Over the Counter ('OTC') derivative contracts with banks or other financial institutions. If these organisations experience financial difficulty, they may be unable to pay back the sums that they owe under the OTC derivative contracts. If this happens, the value of the investment will fall.
- ·  The investment policy applied to this fund may mean that it cannot invest in some companies or in certain sectors. These restrictions mean that should the sectors in which the fund cannot invest be the best performing ones the value of the Fund will not increase as strongly as the value of funds which can invest in these sectors.
- ·  The fund manager may lend stock to other parties and it is usual for the borrower to provide collateral. If the borrower fails to return the borrowed stock, the collateral may not be enough to cover the value of the stock, resulting in a reduction in the fund value.
- ·  The fund should be utilised as part of a diversified investment strategy within a wider portfolio of funds. These funds are not designed to be solely invested in.
- ·  This fund is able to delay paying out, which may mean that you have to wait to get your money. A delay may happen when market conditions mean it is difficult for the fund manager to cash in investments to pay out to investors. For example, a fund with investments in commercial properties may find they may take time to sell. Whilst waiting to complete on the sale of properties, the fund manager may suspend making payments to investors who want to cash in. The fund can only delay paying out if it is in the interests of all investors.
