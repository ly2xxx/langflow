How you invest your pension account

This guide includes details of the range of investment options you can choose from in the J.P. Morgan UK Pension Plan (the Plan) and will help you understand the important features of those options.

Important: the Company meets the administration costs associated with the Plan, but it's important you understand the underlying investment charges as these are met by you from your pension account.

How you plan to take your savings in retirement

The costs and charges your account faces over the period to your retirement

Before making your choices, you should read My Investments and My Default Strategy . You may also want to read My Tax Guide . More information on these documents can be found on page 71 and 72.

Remember that pension investments are long term. Over time, as and when your circumstances change, make sure you regularly check that your investment choices remain appropriate.

How you invest will depend on your personal circumstances and attitude to risk.

## Remember

Although your pension account is a long-term investment and it is generally not a good idea to trade your investments frequently, you should review your investment choices at least once a year (or if your plans or circumstances change) and make sure your choices are still appropriate.

## Risk

Risk means different things to different people. When choosing your investments, you should think about how much risk you are prepared to take. In particular, it is important to consider your capacity and tolerance for risk.

## What you need to think about

## Capacity

If you are a long way from accessing your retirement benefits, you will normally have more capacity for risk. For example, if your investments fall in the short term you still have plenty of time for their value to potentially recover, and in the meantime, if you are still contributing to a pension scheme, you will be purchasing more units and benefiting from additional compound returns. If you are nearer retirement your capacity for risk is normally lower as your investments may not recover in time for your retirement.

## Tolerance

This sums up your own feelings and is a personal measure of the amount of risk you are willing to take with your investments and how you would feel if your investments were/uni00A0to fall in value at any point in time.

Between different types of assets (or asset classes), there are different levels of risk and potential return. Even within an asset class, there are different levels of risk and potential return that depend on what the fund manager is trying to achieve.

To help you decide which funds to invest in, each fund has been assigned a risk ranking (see page 7).

## Risk

## What does the risk ranking represent?

-  The risk rankings will help you understand the different levels of risk when investing your money compared to other funds within the fund range. The risk rankings are only meant to be a guide and are for comparison only.
-  The risk rankings are based on the Trustee's assessment of investment risk, and reflect advice from their investment advisers.
-  The number reflects the Trustee's assessment of the total risk level of each fund, taking into account the individual components of risk which the Trustee has considered and to which each fund is exposed. The component risks considered are set out on page 11 and 12.
-  The scale runs from 1 to 12, where '1' represents the lowest level of risk amongst the funds available via the Plan, and '12' represents the highest.
-  Generally, funds with a lower risk ranking will tend to have lower potential returns and lower volatility of the investment returns, while funds with a higher risk ranking will tend to have higher potential returns and higher volatility of investment returns, although there is no guarantee that this will be the case in practice.

## What does the risk ranking not represent?

-  A fund with a risk ranking of 6 is likely to be more risky than a fund rated 5, but less risky than a fund rated 7, but this does not mean it will have half the risk of a fund with a ranking of 12.
-  There may be times when a lower ranked fund could experience losses in excess of a higher ranked fund. This could be the result of a fund having a high exposure to a particular risk that causes it to lose money for an extended period.
-  There is no guarantee that investors in a fund with a high risk ranking will be compensated for the risk they are taking on. The levels of investment risk may change in the future.
-  The rankings do not necessarily show the 'best' or 'worst' investment for you. It is important to make investment decisions on the basis of your own circumstances and level of risk tolerance. You may wish to consider taking your own impartial financial advice.

## Risk rankings

The following table shows the risk ranking applied to each fund and allows you to see how the risk rankings vary between funds in the same asset class. To understand the individual component risks to which each fund is exposed, please turn to page 9.

## Risk vs return

Between different types of assets (or asset classes) there are different levels of risk and potential return, as shown in the diagram below. So, for example, equities have a very different risk and return profile to cash.

The position of each fund on the ranking scale is determined by the assessed risk associated with it. Its position along the vertical axis represents the potential average long-term investment return for that fund, while the coloured funnel represents the potential volatility of returns.

## Risk and return expectations for the Plan's funds

The chart below shows all of the Plan's funds grouped by risk rating, where 12 indicates the highest risk. The height of each fund grouping indicates the volatility of the potential long-term investment return in Sterling terms and the dotted line shows the average potential long-term investment return.

## The components of risk

When preparing the risk rankings, the following types or 'components' of risk have been considered:

The position of each fund on the ranking scale is determined by the assessed risk associated with it. Its position along the vertical axis represents the potential average long-term investment return for that fund, while the coloured funnel represents the potential volatility of returns.

## Asset class risks

-  Market risk: this is the risk that the value of your investments will fall. It's what most of us think of when we think of 'risk'.
-  Volatility risk: is the variability of returns relative to their expected return, which means it relates to how often and how sharply the market price of an investment changes.
-  Inflation risk: if your investment returns are lower than inflation then the purchasing power of your pension account goes down. This is inflation risk.
-  Currency risk: is the risk of the potential loss in an investment's value following a change in price of one currency against another. It's also known as exchange rate risk.
-  Interest rate risk: relates to the change in the value of an investment asset as a result of a change in interest rates. This type of risk is greater in assets like bonds where if interest rates rise, bond prices fall and vice versa.
-  Credit risk: is the risk of default. Again, this is more relevant to investments like bonds where there is the risk that the issuer (the company or government offering the bonds) may be unable or unwilling to make further income and/or principal payments. UK Government bonds or gilts, for example, are usually considered to have very low credit risk.
-  Emerging market risk: are country specific risks that could affect the value of an investment in an emerging market. Risks include changes in the political climate, natural disasters, currency risk and the risk that you will have difficulties buying and selling in that market if it is relatively small (known as illiquidity risk).

<!-- image -->

## Private markets risks

Whilst private markets assets are subject to other types of risk (such as market risk and liquidity risk), there are two specific risks associated with this type of asset.

-  Valuation risk: private markets investments are not listed on a stock exchange. The underlying assets are valued less frequently than public assets. Valuations may also be approximate or estimated. This means that actual returns may vary depending on when assets are sold, when compared to historical valuations.
-  Benchmark risks: in the Initial and Mid Growth Portfolios, there is a target level of investment in private markets. However, the actual allocation may differ from the target, driven by valuation timing points and market conditions. This is a particular consideration for private markets due to the valuation risks and less frequent trading periods mentioned above.

<!-- image -->

## The components of risk

## Fund specific risks

-  Active manager risk: there is a risk that the decisions taken by an investment manager may have a detrimental impact on the returns of a fund. A passive manager will not make many investment decisions other than how to best track the performance of an index. Active managers will buy and sell investments with the intention of out-performing a specific benchmark. The benchmark may be:
- -a specific index (for example, FTSE All-Share Index for UK equity);
- -other investment managers (for example, a median return of investment funds investing in the same sector);
- -referenced against cash (for example, UK base rate).

The degree of active decisions made by a manager will vary by fund and will, in part, be dependent on the investment objective of the investment fund. If successful, active management can out-perform relative to the benchmark. However, if the manager's decisions prove unsuccessful, they can under-perform relative to the benchmark.

-  Smaller company risk: is the potential, increased risk of investing in a smaller company which may not have the same level of market information or quality assurance available as for a larger company. They are also more susceptible to volatility, because being smaller, it takes lower transaction volumes (buying and selling of shares) to move/uni00A0prices.
-  Liquidity risk: relates to how easily an asset can be bought or sold. If an asset is illiquid, it can't easily be sold or exchanged for cash quickly without a substantial loss in value.
-  Derivatives risk: a derivative is a type of contract between two parties (like a future or a swap) where its value is based on or derived from an underlying asset, index or interest rate. These types of assets can change dramatically in value as a result of small changes in the value of the underlying asset. There is also a potential risk that the other party may default on the contract, known as counterparty risk (a type of credit risk).

## Other risks

-  Benefit matching risk: this is the risk that your investments are not aligned with your preferred method of funding your retirement, and may therefore result in a lower income in retirement. If you choose to buy an annuity, the cost of converting your pension account from a pot of money into an annual income (annuity) is linked in part to the price of government and corporate bonds. If you decide to take benefits through income drawdown, there is also the risk that your investment strategy may not be suitable for the way you intend to take benefits in retirement.

- *  The Blended Annuity Portfolio is not currently available as a Freestyle option. It is used within the Annuity Pathway and targets buying an annuity and taking tax-free cash when you take your benefits.
- ** This fund may be suitable if you plan to purchase an annuity when you take your benefits, as it is designed to track annuity prices (which rise and fall with changes in interest rates). It is not designed to protect the capital value of your pension account.

## Lifestyle switching

If you have selected Lifestyle overlay funds in the Freestyle strategy, they will start the switching process around six years* before your Target Retirement Age (TRA). Your investments will be progressively moved out of your chosen Lifestyle overlay funds into the LGIM Pre-Retirement Annuity Fund and the JPM UK Liquidity Fund in the same percentages as if you chose to invest in the Annuity Pathway.

How quickly your investments will move is illustrated below.

## 5-year switching process

This switching process starts 5 years 9 months from your TRA, or 6 years from your TRA if you remain an active member of the Plan, as set out in the graph to the right.

Switching will take place quarterly and will reallocate your contributions and pension account investments towards the target percentages shown in the graph on the right. Switches for Lifestyle overlay funds do not incur additional administration charges but will include transaction charges.

* Please note that if you are invested in Lifestyle overlay funds and last instructed a change in your investments before January 2019, you will have had the choice to start switching funds around 3, 5, or 10 years before your TRA. If you chose a 10 or 3 year term then your switching process will not mirror the above.

** Please note that the normal minimum pension age will increase to 57 in 2028 and is then expected to increase in line with State Pension Age increases.

JPM UK Liquidity

This approach is designed to meet the needs of members who plan to buy an annuity and take tax-free cash with their benefits. If you don't plan to do this, the current overlay approach is less likely to be suitable for you.

## Target Retirement Age

Your Target Retirement Age (TRA) is the age at which you aim to take your benefits from your pension account. Currently it can be any age between age 55** and 75.

You can select a TRA on MyPension. This is particularly important if you have selected any Lifestyle overlay funds or are in the Default Strategy (or an Alternative Pathway).

This is because this age determines when your investments begin switching into age-appropriate investments, such as bond and/or liquidity funds, as you approach retirement. It's important that you review the age you've chosen to ensure it's in keeping with your retirement plans.

If you do not select a TRA, it is assumed that you will retire at age 60 for the purpose of your pension within the Plan./uni00A0

## Your investment choices on MyPension

## Remember

## Current, future, or both?

If you invest in Freestyle funds, you can make different decisions for where your current assets and/or future contributions will be invested.

-  To update your future contributions only , tick the box next to 'Update my Future contributions' , and then select 'Continue' .

The next page will allow you to add your chosen funds for future contributions.

Don't forget if you want a Freestyle fund with a Lifestyle overlay, make sure you select the Lifestyle version of the fund (the one you want will have 'Lifestyle' in the name).

## Rebalance

## Specific funds

Rebalance , which means you'll move all of your current assets to your new choice. If so:

-  The next page you'll see will allow you to choose where to invest all the funds you have elected to sell across your new fund choices.
-  If you have elected any Lifestyle overlay funds, the next page will ask for your Target Retirement Age (see page 14).

Select specific funds to switch. To do this make sure 'Select individual funds' is ticked. If so:

-  The next page you'll see will allow you to sell the desired percentage from your chosen funds.
-  The following page will then allow you to redistribute all the funds you have elected to sell across a new fund choice.
-  If you have elected any Lifestyle overlay funds, the next page will ask for your Target Retirement Age.

Important: If you have more than one period of service under the Plan, any switches you instruct only apply to the record for the period of service that you are viewing at that time. You can move between your records by selecting the 'Benefit records' icon, which you'll find in the top right hand corner of MyPension.

## Costs

Although there are no administrative charges for switching, all fund switches will incur transaction costs when buying and selling the underlying assets in which the funds are invested. These transaction/ dealing costs (such as broker's commission and local taxes) can either be included implicitly in the pricing of a fund (known as 'single pricing') or they can be taken into account as part of an explicit pricing mechanism (known as 'single swinging pricing'). Find out more in My Investments .

## The fund range

The table on pages 17 and 18 shows the performance history for all the current funds, after the deduction of investment management fees, and has been sourced from the investment managers. Where historic performance is not available (if/uni00A0a fund hasn't been available within the Plan for long enough, for example), the investment manager has made an estimate.

This table provides members with an estimate of the returns they would have seen had these funds been available throughout the relevant period. The outperformance target for each manager against their benchmark is also shown. Past performance is not a guide to the future, and the value of investments can go down as well as up. Investors may not recoup the value of their original investment.

## Charges

## Competitive charges for our funds

The Trustee continues to negotiate investment charges for our funds that are lower than those available if you were to invest in the same investments via the retail market. The Trustee negotiated a significant reduction to the fees for many of the Plan's funds, effective 1 July 2024. See individual fund pages for details.

## Unit Prices and ISIN/SEDOL requests

For the latest information on your funds, please visit the Useful Information tab on MyPension and the specific manager websites listed on page 71. Details of all the funds you can currently invest in are found in this guide - and are also on MyPension.

Please note: historic versions of these documents have listed funds' ISIN and SEDOL codes (where available) to allow members to monitor funds themselves. Since the platform funds are invested in the non-platform equivalents, the codes for the non-platform versions of these funds are available to provide indicative information. Please note, there may be differences between the reported performance of platform and non-platform versions of the funds going forward, due to differences in applicable fees, performance measurement and pricing methodology.

For certain funds, there is no ISIN or SEDOL code as the funds are not listed on a public exchange. This may be because they are bespoke to the Plan, or because they are pooled fund vehicles that do not require a public listing.

-  Aim to outperform the benchmark (Active)

## Chart 1 Highest and Lowest 12 Month Absolute Return

This chart shows the highest and lowest performance return for individual 12 month periods experienced by the Plan's funds over the five years to 30 September 2024. For example, the 12 months to 30 September 2024, the 12 months to 30 September 2023, and the 12 months to 30 September 2022 would be considered as three separate 12 month periods for this purpose. The median return for a fund is a form of average return, calculated by arranging the set of 12 month period returns for that particular fund in order from highest to lowest and selecting one single 12 month return which falls in the middle of this range. For example, the Baillie Gifford Positive Change Fund shows that the fund's highest annual return over the 5 years to 30 September 2024 was 85.9%, while its lowest return over the same period was -30.7%.

Funds with less than five years' performance history have not been included.

## Range of returns

## Chart 2

## Highest and Lowest 12 Month Return Relative to Benchmark

This chart shows the largest outperformance and underperformance of 12 month returns relative to benchmark over the five years to 30 September 2024. The chart therefore gives an indication of the deviation of the investment managers' performance from benchmark. As expected, the deviation of the passive investment manager's returns (LGIM) is low, whilst the deviation for active managers' returns are expected to be high. The LGIM Diversified Fund is benchmarked against the UK Base Rate, which is why it has a larger deviation relative to its benchmark than we might expect for a passive fund.

For example, for the Baillie Gifford Positive Change Fund the deviation is high. The Baillie Gifford Positive Change Fund's greatest 12-month outperformance over the five years to 30 September 2024 was 66.5%, while the greatest underperformance over the same period was -27.0%.

Funds with less than five years' performance history have not been included.

## LGIM UK Equity (5% Capped) Index

This fund enables investment in the UK equity market while controlling exposure to the largest stocks in the FTSE All-Share Index.

The fund aims to restrict the weighting to each individual stock to a maximum of 5% of the index. Those stocks whose individual weightings are above 5% of the index are restricted to 5%, whilst all remaining stocks are managed in proportion to their weightings in the FTSE All-Share Index. This fund may underperform the FTSE All-Share Index, or may outperform, but the volatility of the returns should be lower than the FTSE All-Share Index.

As the fund invests entirely in equities, this fund is likely to be subject to greater volatility than many other funds. However, as it aims to track its benchmark, the risk of underperformance against the benchmark is small relative to an active fund. As the fund invests in equities, it has the potential to provide higher returns than other funds over the long term.

## Baillie Gifford Worldwide Discovery

This fund aims to produce attractive long-term returns, mainly through capital growth. The fund will invest primarily in equities which are listed, traded or dealt in on Regulated Markets worldwide and which will typically be stocks of smaller or younger companies that the Investment Manager considers to have strong future growth prospects.

The fund seeks out initially immature entrepreneurial companies from across the world. Importantly, it is the immaturity of the opportunity which is key, and not just smallness. Companies typically have a market capitalisation of $10bn or smaller at time of initial purchase and will often have pronounced levels of innovation and a differentiated strategy.

As the fund invests entirely in equities and seeks to outperform the benchmark return, this fund is likely to be subject to greater volatility than many other funds. However, it has the potential to provide higher returns than other funds over the long term. In addition there is a risk that some currencies may fluctuate relative to the value of sterling.

## Berenberg Managed Volatility Equity

This fund provides exposure to global equities in line with the MSCI World Climate Change Index. The fund also offers a level of downside protection, by using exchange-listed options which offer in-built risk mitigation from a certain level of equity market falls.

## The fund aims to:

- ·  Limit maximum market drawdowns to around 20% on an annual basis
- ·  Keep volatility within 10% - 15% on an annual basis
- ·  Participate 90% - 100% in positive equity market returns

It incorporates a degree of risk mitigation, but at a lower level than the Berenberg Limited Volatility Equity Fund (see next page). It also has a greater potential for growth.

## Berenberg Limited Volatility Equity

This fund is a blend of the Berenberg Managed Volatility Equity Fund and the JPM UK Liquidity Fund. It provides exposure to global equities in line with the MSCI World Climate Change Index, and to a range of UK short-term money market investments.

## The fund aims to:

- · Limit maximum market drawdowns to around 10% on an annual basis
- · Keep volatility under 10% on an annual basis
- · Allow equity market upside of around 3% per month

It has a lower potential for investment risk than the Berenberg Managed Volatility Equity Fund (see previous page), with a lower potential for growth.

At a point in the future when assets in this blend reach a meaningful level and a new share class of the Berenberg strategy can be launched, assets will move out of the blend into the new share class.

## LGIM World Equity Index (Hedged)

This fund has been designed to match the return of equity markets across the world. The fund is 100% hedged to sterling, which reduces the effect of changes in asset values from fluctuations in currency markets.

The fund aims to track the performance of the FTSE World Index (less withholding tax where applicable) - GBP Hedged.

As the fund invests entirely in equities, this fund is likely to be subject to greater volatility than many other funds. However, as it aims to track its benchmark, the risk of underperformance against the benchmark is low relative to an actively managed fund.

## LGIM World Equity Index (Unhedged)

This fund has been designed to match the total return of equity markets across the world. It aims to track the performance of the FTSE World Index (less withholding tax where applicable).

The fund does not employ currency hedging , so the total return will comprise the return of the underlying markets and any currency fluctuations.

As the fund invests entirely in equities, this fund is likely to be subject to greater volatility than many other funds. However, as it aims to track its benchmark, the risk of underperformance against the benchmark is low relative to an actively managed fund. In addition, there is a risk that some currencies may fluctuate in value relative to sterling.

## LGIM Global Equity Fixed Weight (30:70) Index

This fund provides access to the UK and overseas equity markets. The fund's benchmark is 30% UK equities and 70% overseas equities.

Investing overseas adds an element of protection by spreading risk among a number of markets. The fund aims to track a composite of world indices, with 70% in overseas equities.

The LGIM Global Equity Fixed Weight (30:70) Index Fund employs currency hedging to reduce the effect of changes in asset values from fluctuations in the currency market due to investments in non-Sterling assets. The fund aims to hedge 75% of the non-Sterling currency exposure.

As the fund invests entirely in equities, this fund is likely to be subject to greater volatility than many other funds. However, as it aims to track its benchmark, the risk of underperformance against the benchmark is small relative to an active fund. As the fund invests in equities, it has the potential to provide higher returns than other funds over the long term. In addition, there is a risk that some currencies may fluctuate in value relative to sterling, although this is partially mitigated via currency hedging.

## Baillie Gifford Emerging Markets

This fund aims to capture the return of emerging markets across Latin America, Europe/Middle East/Africa and Asia.

Emerging market equities are likely to have very volatile returns, with periods of high positive returns followed by periods of large negative returns. Baillie Gifford believe that they can add value by long-term investment in well-managed quality businesses that have high upside potential. This fund has a positive exposure to growth-oriented factors. The portfolio typically hold between 60 and 120 emerging market stocks with a 40% turnover. The currency exposure is not hedged.

As the fund invests entirely in equities, particularly emerging market equities and seeks to outperform the benchmark return, this fund is likely to be subject to greater volatility than many other funds. However, it has the potential to provide higher returns than other funds over the long term. In addition there is a risk that some currencies may fluctuate relative to the value of sterling and additional risk of investing in emerging markets such as political stability, expropriation of assets and lack of infrastructure and institutional development.

## JPM All-Emerging Markets Equity

This fund aims to capture the return of emerging markets across Latin America, Europe/Middle East/Africa and Asia.

Emerging market equities are likely to have very volatile returns, with periods of high positive returns followed by periods of large negative returns. JPM believe that emerging markets are inefficient and outperformance comes from buying good businesses at the right price, and avoiding overvalued stocks and markets. The approach has both quality and growth elements. The portfolio is likely to be concentrated between 65 and 75 holdings with a 30% turnover. The currency exposure is not hedged.

As the fund invests entirely in equities, particularly emerging market equities and seeks to outperform the benchmark return, this fund is likely to be subject to greater volatility than many other funds. However, it has the potential to provide higher returns than other funds over the long term.

## Baillie Gifford Managed

The Baillie Gifford Managed Fund invests in a number of asset classes including UK equities, overseas equities, UK bonds, cash and cash equivalents.

Allocations to the underlying asset classes are achieved by investing in other equity, bond and liquidity funds managed by Baillie Gifford. The majority of outperformance is expected to be generated by stock selection in these underlying funds.

As a balanced fund investing mainly in equities and seeking to outperform its benchmark return, this fund will be subject to less volatility than an actively managed pure equity fund, but has the potential to provide greater growth than pure bond/gilt or liquidity funds. In addition, there is a risk that some currencies may fluctuate in value relative to sterling.

Long-term performance history includes time invested in the Baillie Gifford Diversified Growth Fund, prior to the move to the Sustainable Multi Asset Fund in 2022.

## LGIM Diversified

This fund invests in a range of asset classes including: global equities (including UK), private equity, property, absolute return funds, high yield debt and commodities.

Uses primarily passive underlying funds managed by LGIM, though some asset classes are managed on an active basis and may not necessarily be managed by LGIM.

## Strategic asset allocation

As this fund invests in a broad range of asset classes (including alternatives that do not fit into the mainstream categories of equities, bonds, cash and property), this fund is expected to have lower volatility and returns than pure equity funds but has the potential to provide higher returns than pure bond/gilt funds. In addition there is a risk that some currencies may fluctuate in value relative to sterling, however, the fund does employ currency hedging to remove some of this risk.

The strategic asset allocation will be reviewed periodically (typically annually) by LGIM. LGIM will not seek to take short-term, tactical asset allocation positions.

## Fidelity Aggregate Bond (Sustainable)

This fund invests in a mixture of bond types. The fund's benchmark allocation is 50% to UK Corporate Bonds, and 50% to UK gilts.

The exposure to these bonds is obtained by investing in underlying bond funds managed by Fidelity. Fidelity will take asset allocation decisions around this benchmark allocation, dependent on their view on the relative attractiveness of each type of bond. They may also invest a portion of the fund in overseas bonds, index-linked bonds, emerging market bonds or high yield bonds.

As the fund invests entirely in bonds, it should be subject to less volatility than either balanced or equity funds. However, as the fund invests solely in debt securities, it is unlikely to produce returns as high as balanced or equity funds over the long term. As the cost of purchasing a pension is closely linked to long-term bonds, investing your pension assets in a bond fund carries less risk than investing in equities.

## Insight Bonds Plus 300

This is an absolute return bond strategy which aims to achieve a positive return over cash whilst minimising drawdowns.

Insight believe that a return can be achieved in all market conditions by targeting the best risk-adjusted investment opportunities and spreading the risk; although there is no guarantee this will be achieved.

The strategy has an emphasis on capital preservation and seeks to avoid interest rate risk of traditional bond funds; Insight do not exclude any fixed income sources of return and utilise a broad fixed income opportunity set, e.g. government, inflation linked, corporate, emerging market debt, high yield, loans, asset backed securities and currency.

## JPM Flexible Credit

This fund is an unconstrained bond strategy, which seeks to provide diverse exposure to the global credit universe with some degree of downside protection.

The strategy is a pure credit strategy, which invests in a broad range of corporate credit assets (investment grade and high yield across both developed and emerging markets, along with an allocation to more specialist sectors) to deliver a target return of 5% (+/-2%) over a market cycle. Financial derivative instruments are used where appropriate. The strategy by nature, however, is likely to underperform when credit markets are out of favour. The share class accessed by the Plan employs currency hedging to remove the majority of the impact of currency risk on the fund's return.

The fund invests solely in debt securities, it is unlikely to produce returns as high as balanced or equity funds over the long term.

## LGIM Pre-Retirement Annuity

LGIM's Pre-Retirement Annuity Fund invests in assets that broadly reflect the investments underlying a typical non-inflation linked pension annuity product with the aim of offering protection against changes in annuity prices.

This is achieved through investment in a number of LGIM's corporate bond and gilt funds.

As the fund invests solely in debt securities, it is unlikely to produce returns as high as balanced or equity funds over the long term. This fund may be suitable if you plan to purchase an annuity when you take your benefits, as it is designed to track annuity prices (which rise and fall with changes in interest rates). It is not designed to protect the capital value of your pension account and is less likely to be suitable if you do not plan to buy an annuity. This fund aims to track its benchmark so the risk of under-performance against the benchmark is small relative to an active fund, but there is high risk within the fund arising from exposure to interest rate changes. For example, when interest rates rise sharply this fund is likely to produce a negative return (again, linked to the pricing of annuities).

## LGIM Over 5 Year Index-Linked Gilts Index

Investing in this fund minimizes the risk associated with rises in the cost of providing an inflation-linked pension in the run up to your retirement.

The fund invests in all long-term government index-linked issues and aims to track the FTSE A Over 5 Years Index-Linked Gilts Index, including re-invested income.

As the fund invests entirely in bonds, it should be subject to less volatility than either balanced or equity funds. However, as the fund invests solely in secure government backed issues, it is unlikely to produce returns as high as balanced or equity funds over the long term.

As the cost of purchasing a pension is closely linked to long-term bonds, investing your pension assets in a bond fund carries less risk than investing in equities. This fund aims to track its benchmark so the risk of underperformance against the benchmark is small relative to an active fund.

## Putnam Global High Yield Bond

This fund seeks to achieve excess returns over its benchmark over a full market cycle, with high current income. Capital growth is a secondary goal.

Putnam aims to take full advantage of the global opportunity set to diversify the portfolio, and invest in bonds across countries, industries, sectors, companies, and credit ratings within the global high-yield universe to help reduce volatility. Putnam believes that superior returns relative to the market can be achieved by exploiting inefficiencies that exist in the global high-yield market. The share class accessed by the Plan employs currency hedging to remove the majority of the impact of currency risk on the fund's return.

## Active

## LGIM Euro Liquidity

The principal investment objective of the fund is to provide capital stability, liquidity and diversification while providing a competitive level of return.

The fund invests in short-term, euro based assets issued by governments, banks considered to be high quality, and companies. These assets may include deposits, short-term money market instruments (classed as those that mature within 397 days), and eligible short-term securitisations.

The Trustee added this fund to the Plan's fund range in response to the concerns of members who are approaching retirement and plan to retire in the Eurozone.

While this fund is not a long-term investment option, as inflation will erode its value, it aims to provide some protection from the heightened volatility seen in currency markets for Eurozone retirees.

The fund carries currency conversion risk for those planning to retire in the UK and is not intended as an investment option for UK retirees.

## abrdn Pooled Property Pension

The fund directly invests in a range of predominantly UK properties including offices, retail units (including shopping centres) and industrial units.

The fund may also invest in other abrdn funds in order to gain specialist exposure and aims to outperform its benchmark (MSCI All Balanced Property Funds Index).

As the fund invests entirely in property, the returns will depend in the change in market value of the individual properties and rental return. The fund is likely to have risk return characteristics between those of equities and bonds.

Please note that abrdn was previously known as Aberdeen Standard Investments. There is no change to the underlying strategy as a result of the change.

## Partners Group Generations

The Partners Group Generations Fund (the Partners Fund) is a Private Markets fund investing in a range of private markets including assets in private equity, private debt, private infrastructure and private real estate investments. Please ensure you have read and understood the risks that are associated with private markets assets on page 9.

It offers an opportunity for long-term capital growth by investing in multi asset private markets compared to traditional private market funds, which invest through a blend of listed and direct holdings. The fund employs currency hedging to remove most of the impact of currency risk on the fund's return.

## Important: monthly trading

## Gross exposure

Private equity 32.0% Senior loans 25.0% Liquid private markets 22.0% Private infrastructure 10.0% Private real estate 6.0% Private debt 5.0%

## Regional exposure

North America 57.0%

Europe 35.0%

Asia-Pacific 6.0%

Rest of World 2.0%

Figures may not sum to total due to rounding.

Due to the structure of the Partners Fund, trades into and out of it are only processed once a month (the first working day of each month). This means:

-  Any daily dealt funds you choose to switch into the Partners Fund will be sold and held as cash in the Trustee's bank account until the next monthly dealing date. This means you could be exposed to out-of-market risk and miss out on potential investment returns while your assets are held as cash. Your instruction must be submitted at least five working days before the last working day of the previous month for Partners Fund assets to be bought on the first working day of the next month. This also applies to any pension savings you wish to transfer into the Plan and invest in the Partners Fund. You should therefore consider this timing when switching assets into the Partners Fund.
-  If you wish to switch assets out of the Partners Fund, your sell instruction must be submitted by 7am on the last working day of the month. These assets will be sold on the first working day of the following month. You will therefore need to consider this timing when switching assets out of the Partners Fund. Read more in the Partners Factsheet.

## Currency hedging

Yes - Provided by Partners Group: In general 60-80% of the exposure is GBP hedged.

## Blended Initial Growth Portfolio

This fund is invested in a combination of higher-risk investments which provide a broad set of sources of return with the potential to enhance long-term returns for members. The benchmark for this fund is a composite of the benchmarks of the underlying fund allocations.

The Initial Growth Portfolio is one of three blended funds that form the investment allocation of the Default Strategy and is also available on a Freestyle basis.

Please note, by selecting this fund, you are selecting the blended fund and understand that the components of this fund are subject to change by the Trustee. This can include the addition or removal of a fund(s) from the funds allocation as well as potential adjustment to the underlying fund weightings.

This may be done without notice and without your agreement, however, in most cases, it is expected that you will be notified in advance.

## Glossary of terms

This section gives a glossary of some of the terms that you may have come across in this guide.

## Absolute Return

Investment strategies targeting a positive return in absolute terms rather than relative to an index or other benchmark. These can also be referred to as 'cash plus' funds.

## Alpha

Measure of the incremental return added by an investment manager through active management.

## Annuity

At retirement you may choose for your pension fund to be used to buy an annuity. An annuity is a contract with an insurance company to pay an annual income for the rest of your life.

## Benchmark

A level of investment return, against which the performance of the investment manager is measured (for active managers) or which the investment manager aims to follow (for passive managers).

## Blended funds

Blended funds combine several underlying funds in proportions that are designed to meet certain objectives, for example, to manage risk whilst still growing your pension account. These type of funds allow the Trustee to diversify the risk and return that investors are exposed to and the management of allocations over time.

## Commodities

Any raw materials - examples include oil, gold and cattle.

## Derivatives

Financial instruments whose value is dependent on the value of an underlying index, currency, commodity or other asset. Examples include options, forwards, futures and swaps.

## Duration

Average time-weighted life of the payment stream from a bond or stream of cash flows, taking into account the present value of each cash flow. In practice, duration is the measure of sensitivity to interest rates.

## Equities (also known as shares or stocks)

Share in the ownership of a company that gives the holder the right to receive distributed profits and to vote at general meetings of the company (ordinary shares).

## Forward

Bespoke contract to buy or sell an asset at an agreed price at a specified date in the future.

## Future

Standardised forwards that are traded on an organised exchange and subject to the rules of the exchange.

## Growth stock

Stock that is expected to achieve above average earnings growth. Growth stocks normally have a higher P/E ratio (see overleaf) relative to the market as a whole, as investors anticipate that earnings will increase in the future. Growth investors/managers seek out growth stocks.

## High yield bonds

Corporate bond that has been given a low credit rating/sub investment grade by credit rating agencies.

## Index

A measure updated regularly that gives a representation of the movement in value of a particular market or a specified group of securities.

## ISIN

An International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) is a code that uniquely identifies a specific securities issue.

## Median

A measure of the 'average'. It is found by arranging all of the values in order and then selecting the one in the middle. For example, a median performance among a group of five managers would be the third ranked manager.

## Glossary of terms

## Options

Give the owner of the option the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security at an agreed price within an agreed time period.

## Private Equity

Shares in unquoted companies. Usually high risk/high return in nature, and can be very illiquid.

## SEDOL

Stock Exchange Daily Official List (SEDOL), is a list of security identifiers used in the UK and Ireland for clearing purposes.

## SONIA

Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) is an important interest rate benchmark, referring to the overnight interest r ate paid by banks for unsecured transactions in the British sterling market.

## Strategic asset allocation

Allocation between asset classes.

## Swaps

Contracts which permit investors to exchange payment streams for their mutual benefit.

## Tactical asset allocation

Short-term deviation from a strategic asset allocation to exploit predicted short-term relative movements in markets with the aim of generating excess return relative to a benchmark.

## TER

The Total Expense Ratio (TER) is the sum of the total explicit costs deducted annually by the manager of an investment fund, divided by the total value of the fund. These costs include the investment manager's fees (commonly referred to as the Annual Management Charge (AMC)), as well as administrative, legal and operational costs, among others.

## Tracking error/Volatility

The variability of returns relative to their mean or expected return, this is typically quantified as standard deviation.
