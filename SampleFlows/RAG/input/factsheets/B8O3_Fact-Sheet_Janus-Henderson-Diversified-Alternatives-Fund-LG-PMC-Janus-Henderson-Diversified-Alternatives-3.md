Performance data source: Lipper. Returns are calculated on the basis of daily midday dealing prices, those at which you transact. Other fact sheets may show returns on a different basis, e.g. daily midday mid-market prices. Fund performance is shown net, which is after the deduction of the fund management charge.

The fund performance does not take account of any product charges applicable to your scheme. You can find more information about our charges in the terms and conditions booklet (for example, the Member's Booklet and Member's Policy Booklet) or Key Features documents.

Past performance is not a guide to the future. The value of an investment is not guaranteed and can go down as well as up. Exchange rate variations can cause the value of overseas investments to increase or decrease. You may not get back the amount you originally invested. For overseas markets the figures are sterling adjusted and net of any withholding tax.

## FUND SPECIFIC RISKS

- ·  The fund invests in equities (shares of companies), so there is a higher risk of the fund's value being volatile (i.e. going up and down) than with a fund which invests in most other asset types, particularly in the short term.
- ·  Investment returns on fixed interest securities, such as corporate and government bonds, are particularly sensitive to trends in interest rate movements and inflation. Their values are likely to fall when interest rates rise. Such falls may be more pronounced in a low, or negative interest rate environment and longer dated fixed interest securities will fall by more than short dated fixed interest securities.
- ·  The fund invests in fixed interest securities. The financial strength of a company or government issuing the security determines their ability to make some or all of the payments due. If this financial strength weakens, the chances of them not making payments increases and this will reduce the Fund's value.
- ·  The Fund may undertake derivative transactions in line with the FCA Conduct of Business rules (COBS 21). The Fund may invest in other collective investment schemes, which use derivatives for investment purposes as opposed to solely for efficient portfolio management or reduction in investment risk.
- ·  The Fund may hold Over the Counter ('OTC') derivative contracts with banks or other financial institutions. If these organisations experience financial difficulty, they may be unable to pay back the sums that they owe under the OTC derivative contracts. If this happens, the value of the investment will fall.
- ·  The fund manager may lend stock to other parties and it is usual for the borrower to provide collateral. If the borrower fails to return the borrowed stock, the collateral may not be enough to cover the value of the stock, resulting in a reduction in the fund value.
- ·  The fund invests in inflation-linked bonds, which are particularly sensitive to changes in inflation rates. Their values are likely to fall when inflation rates fall.
- ·  Exchange Traded Funds generally try to match the performance of a share index, such as the FTSE 100 index, or to track the price of commodities such as oil or gold. Exchange Traded Funds can use a number of different techniques to achieve their goals (including the use of derivatives) and as a consequence can be more complex than traditional funds. The value of this investment may go up and down more often and by larger amounts, particularly in the short term.
- ·  The Fund may invest in instruments providing exposure to the commodities market. Exposure is typically gained indirectly through investment in underlying funds which invests in financial derivative instruments referencing commodities indices and financial instruments linked to, or backed by the performance of, commodities. Investments in derivatives related to commodities can be highly volatile: market prices of commodities derivatives may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including; changes in supply and demand, other trading considerations generally or in the relevant commodity, domestic and international political and economic events, natural events such as weather conditions, agricultural factors, diseases, or technological developments.
- ·  This fund is able to delay paying out, which may mean that you have to wait to get your money. A delay may happen when market conditions mean it is difficult for the fund manager to cash in investments to pay out to investors. For example, a fund with investments in commercial properties may find they may take time to sell. Whilst waiting to complete on the sale of properties, the fund manager may suspend making payments to investors who want to cash in. The fund can only delay paying out if it is in the interests of all investors.
