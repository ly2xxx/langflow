Performance data source: Lipper. Returns are calculated on the basis of daily midday dealing prices, those at which you transact. Other fact sheets may show returns on a different basis, e.g. daily midday mid-market prices. Fund performance is shown net, which is after the deduction of the fund management charge.

The fund performance does not take account of any product charges applicable to your scheme. You can find more information about our charges in the terms and conditions booklet (for example, the Member's Booklet and Member's Policy Booklet) or Key Features documents.

Past performance is not a guide to the future. The value of an investment is not guaranteed and can go down as well as up. Exchange rate variations can cause the value of overseas investments to increase or decrease. You may not get back the amount you originally invested. For overseas markets the figures are sterling adjusted and net of any withholding tax.

## FUND SPECIFIC RISKS

- ·  Investment returns on fixed interest securities, such as corporate and government bonds, are particularly sensitive to trends in interest rate movements and inflation. Their values are likely to fall when interest rates rise. Such falls may be more pronounced in a low, or negative interest rate environment and longer dated fixed interest securities will fall by more than short dated fixed interest securities.
- ·  The fund invests in fixed interest securities. The financial strength of a company or government issuing the security determines their ability to make some or all of the payments due. If this financial strength weakens, the chances of them not making payments increases and this will reduce the Fund's value.
- ·  The Fund invests almost exclusively in fixed interest bonds from a single or small number of issuers, such as companies or governments. If any of these issuers experience financial difficulty, they may be unable to pay back some or all of the interest, original investment or other payments that they owe. If this happens, the value of the Fund may fall.
- ·  The fund should be utilised as part of a diversified investment strategy within a wider portfolio of funds. These funds are not designed to be solely invested in.
- ·  This fund is able to delay paying out, which may mean that you have to wait to get your money. A delay may happen when market conditions mean it is difficult for the fund manager to cash in investments to pay out to investors. For example, a fund with investments in commercial properties may find they may take time to sell. Whilst waiting to complete on the sale of properties, the fund manager may suspend making payments to investors who want to cash in. The fund can only delay paying out if it is in the interests of all investors.
