## RISK PROFILE

## FUND OBJECTIVE

The investment objective of the fund is to provide diversified exposure to the GBP corporate bond markets and produce a return in line with the performance of the Solactive L&G ESG GBP Investment Grade Corporate TR Index.

<!-- image -->

The fund's risk rating is based on the historic volatility of the fund's value and it may change in the future.

Investment funds with a lower risk profile typically exhibit fewer price fluctuations and therefore a lower probability of temporary capital losses. Funds with a high risk rating typically experience greater fluctuations in value and maintain a greater risk of capital losses.

Performance data source: LGIM. All performance periods over a year will be annualised. Returns are calculated on the basis of daily midday mid-market prices. Other fund fact sheets may show returns calculated on a different basis, e.g. daily midday dealing prices, those at which you transact. Fund performance is shown net, which is after the deduction of the fund management charge. The fund performance does not take account of any product charges applicable to your scheme. You can find more information about our charges in the terms and conditions booklet (for example, the Member's Booklet and Member's Policy Booklet) or Key Features documents.

Past performance is not a guide to the future. The value of an investment is not guaranteed and can go down as well as up. Exchange rate variations can cause the value of overseas investments to increase or decrease. You may not get back the amount you originally invested. For overseas markets the figures are sterling adjusted and net of any withholding tax.
