The fund's risk rating is based on the historic volatility of the fund's value and it may change in the future.

Investment funds with a lower risk profile typically exhibit fewer price fluctuations and therefore a lower probability of temporary capital losses. Funds with a high risk rating typically experience greater fluctuations in value and maintain a greater risk of capital losses. For more information on the investment risks that are specific to this fund, please refer to the Fund Specific Risks section on page 3.

Performance data source: LGIM. All performance periods over a year will be annualised. Returns are calculated on the basis of daily midday mid-market prices. Other fund fact sheets may show returns calculated on a different basis, e.g. daily midday dealing prices, those at which you transact. Fund performance is shown net, which is after the deduction of the fund management charge.

The fund performance does not take account of any product charges applicable to your scheme. You can find more information about our charges in the terms and conditions booklet (for example, the Member's Booklet and Member's Policy Booklet) or Key Features documents.

Past performance is not a guide to the future. The value of an investment is not guaranteed and can go down as well as up. Exchange rate variations can cause the value of overseas investments to increase or decrease. You may not get back the amount you originally invested. For overseas markets the figures are sterling adjusted and net of any withholding tax.

## FUND SPECIFIC RISKS

- ·  The fund invests in equities (shares of companies), so there is a higher risk of the fund's value being volatile (i.e. going up and down) than with a fund which invests in most other asset types, particularly in the short term.
- ·  Investment returns on fixed interest securities, such as corporate and government bonds, are particularly sensitive to trends in interest rate movements and inflation. Their values are likely to fall when interest rates rise. Such falls may be more pronounced in a low, or negative interest rate environment and longer dated fixed interest securities will fall by more than short dated fixed interest securities.
- ·  The fund invests in fixed interest securities. The financial strength of a company or government issuing the security determines their ability to make some or all of the payments due. If this financial strength weakens, the chances of them not making payments increases and this will reduce the Fund's value.
- ·  The Fund may undertake derivative transactions as part of efficient portfolio management ('EPM') or reduction in investment risk in line with the Historic FCA Permitted Links rules
- ·  The Fund may undertake derivative transactions in line with the FCA Conduct of Business rules (COBS 21). The Fund may invest in other collective investment schemes, which use derivatives for investment purposes as opposed to solely for efficient portfolio management or reduction in investment risk.
- ·  The Fund may hold Over the Counter ('OTC') derivative contracts with banks or other financial institutions. If these organisations experience financial difficulty, they may be unable to pay back the sums that they owe under the OTC derivative contracts. If this happens, the value of the investment will fall.
- ·  The fund invests in emerging markets where there may be limited information available publicly to investors. In general, emerging market issuers are not subject to accounting, auditing and financial standards and requirements similar to those required of developed market issuers. Also, local laws may prevent the repatriation of capital or profit from those countries into the UK. In addition, the stock markets and currencies of emerging markets can be volatile, due to the fact that the political and economic systems in these countries are still developing. In such cases delays in settlement may cause the fund to have exposure to a third party broker or counterparty. This may result in a greater risk that the value of the fund might go down. The investments in these markets might also be bought and sold infrequently therefore resulting in large changes in their prices.
- ·  The fund invests in commercial property. Property can be difficult to buy or sell. This could mean that: Cash remains uninvested; and/or Property may have to be sold for less than expected. If a significant amount of withdrawals from the fund is requested by investors, the fund manager may be forced to sell properties quickly. This could mean that properties are sold for less than expected which would reduce the value of your investment in the Fund. In exceptional circumstances: it may not be possible to sell properties quickly; and/or it may be difficult for independent valuers to assess the market value of the properties held by the Funds. In such circumstances the Company can defer the payment of amounts due on the surrender of Units or suspend dealing in the fund where this is in the interest of all investors in the fund. If dealing is suspended at a time when you want to Surrender Units in the fund, it could become necessary for the Company to delay acting on your instructions. This would lead to a delay in dealing with your request to surrender Units in the fund. If the size of the fund falls significantly, the fund may have to hold fewer properties. This may lead to an increase in its risk as the fund performance will be based on the performance of a small number of properties and therefore the poor performance of one of them will have a larger impact on the fund than if the fund was holding a large number of properties. Rental growth is not guaranteed and unpaid rent could affect the performance of your investment in the fund. The fund may undertake development of properties where the full benefit of any increases in the value of the property or the income earned from it are not received until completion. While any development is taking place, the fund is at risk from delays in receiving the benefit of any improvements, and additional costs. Developments may not achieve the predicted increase in the value of the property or rent. The value of property is generally a matter of valuer's professional opinion rather than fact.
- ·  The fund invests in money market products, with banks and other financial institutions. There is a risk of investing in money market products, if the financial institutions which hold the deposits suffer financial difficulties or become insolvent, they may not pay back some or all of the amount invested with them. This could mean that the Fund might not get back the full amount deposited and its value will fall. Some money market investments may be illiquid. The value of money market securities may fall due to changes in interest rates - including periods of negative interest rates, inflation, creditworthiness, wider credit events or extensions to the anticipated term of investments. If this happens the value of your fund may fall.
- ·  This fund is able to delay paying out, which may mean that you have to wait to get your money. A delay may happen when market conditions mean it is difficult for the fund manager to cash in investments to pay out to investors. For example, a fund with investments in commercial properties may find they may take time to sell. Whilst waiting to complete on the sale of properties, the fund manager may suspend making payments to investors who want to cash in. The fund can only delay paying out if it is in the interests of all investors.
