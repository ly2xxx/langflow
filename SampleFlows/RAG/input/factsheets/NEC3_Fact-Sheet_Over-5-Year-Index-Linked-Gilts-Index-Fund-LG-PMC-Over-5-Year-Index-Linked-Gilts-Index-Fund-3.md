WorkSave Buy Out Plan/WorkSave Pension Plan/WorkSave Pension Trust

## RISK AND REWARD PROFILE

## FUND AIM

To track the performance of the FTSE A Index-linked (Over 5 Year) Index (including re-invested income) to within +/- 0.25% each year for two out of three years.

During periods of stressed market conditions, it may be appropriate for this fund to hold a small amount of cash or other money market assets, and so the fund will not be completely invested in the target asset class.

## FUND FACTS

<!-- image -->

The fund's risk rating is based on the historic volatility of the fund's value and it may change in the future.

Investment funds with a lower risk profile typically exhibit fewer price fluctuations and therefore a lower probability of temporary capital losses. Funds with a high risk rating typically experience greater fluctuations in value and maintain a greater risk of capital losses.

For more information on the investment risks that are specific to this fund, please refer to the Fund Specific Risks section on page 3.

Performance data source: Lipper. Returns are calculated on the basis of daily midday dealing prices, those at which you transact. Other fact sheets may show returns on a different basis, e.g. daily midday mid-market prices. Fund performance is shown net, which is after the deduction of the fund management charge.

The fund performance does not take account of any product charges applicable to your scheme. You can find more information about our charges in the terms and conditions booklet (for example, the Member's Booklet and Member's Policy Booklet) or Key Features documents.

Past performance is not a guide to the future. The value of an investment is not guaranteed and can go down as well as up. Exchange rate variations can cause the value of overseas investments to increase or decrease. You may not get back the amount you originally invested. For overseas markets the figures are sterling adjusted and net of any withholding tax.

## FUND SPECIFIC RISKS

- ·  Investment returns on fixed interest securities, such as corporate and government bonds, are particularly sensitive to trends in interest rate movements and inflation. Their values are likely to fall when interest rates rise. Such falls may be more pronounced in a low, or negative interest rate environment and longer dated fixed interest securities will fall by more than short dated fixed interest securities.
- ·  The fund invests in fixed interest securities. The financial strength of a company or government issuing the security determines their ability to make some or all of the payments due. If this financial strength weakens, the chances of them not making payments increases and this will reduce the Fund's value.
- ·  The Fund invests almost exclusively in fixed interest bonds from a single or small number of issuers, such as companies or governments. If any of these issuers experience financial difficulty, they may be unable to pay back some or all of the interest, original investment or other payments that they owe. If this happens, the value of the Fund may fall.
- ·  The fund invests in inflation-linked bonds, which are particularly sensitive to changes in inflation rates. Their values are likely to fall when inflation rates fall.
- ·  The fund should be utilised as part of a diversified investment strategy within a wider portfolio of funds. These funds are not designed to be solely invested in.
- ·  This fund is able to delay paying out, which may mean that you have to wait to get your money. A delay may happen when market conditions mean it is difficult for the fund manager to cash in investments to pay out to investors. For example, a fund with investments in commercial properties may find they may take time to sell. Whilst waiting to complete on the sale of properties, the fund manager may suspend making payments to investors who want to cash in. The fund can only delay paying out if it is in the interests of all investors.
