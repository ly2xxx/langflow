## L&G PMC Cash Fund 3

WorkSave Buy Out Plan/WorkSave Pension Plan/WorkSave Pension Trust

## FUND AIM

The objective of this Fund is to maintain capital and to provide a return in line with money market rates, before charges.

Notes:

A. The Fund will generally invest in short term deposits, certificates of deposit, government bonds (predominantly UK) issued in pounds sterling (a type of loan that pays interest) and Repos. Repos are an agreement between two parties to sell or buy an asset and later reverse the trade at an agreed date and price.

B. If the interest earned by the fund's assets is insufficient to cover the fund management charge and any additional fund expenses, the unit price will fall.

Performance data source: Lipper. Returns are calculated on the basis of daily midday dealing

prices, those at which you transact. Other fact sheets may show returns on a different basis, e.g. daily midday mid-market prices. Fund performance is shown net, which is after the deduction of the fund management charge.

The fund performance does not take account of any product charges applicable to your scheme. You can find more information about our charges in the terms and conditions booklet (for example, the Member's Booklet and Member's Policy Booklet) or Key Features documents.

Past performance is not a guide to the future. The value of an investment is not guaranteed and can go down as well as up. Exchange rate variations can cause the value of overseas investments to increase or decrease. You may not get back the amount you originally invested. For overseas markets the figures are sterling adjusted and net of any withholding tax.

## FUND SPECIFIC RISKS

- ·  The fund invests in money market products, with banks and other financial institutions. There is a risk of investing in money market products, if the financial institutions which hold the deposits suffer financial difficulties or become insolvent, they may not pay back some or all of the amount invested with them. This could mean that the Fund might not get back the full amount deposited and its value will fall. Some money market investments may be illiquid. The value of money market securities may fall due to changes in interest rates - including periods of negative interest rates, inflation, creditworthiness, wider credit events or extensions to the anticipated term of investments. If this happens the value of your fund may fall.
- ·  The fund should be utilised as part of a diversified investment strategy within a wider portfolio of funds. These funds are not designed to be solely invested in.
- ·  This fund is able to delay paying out, which may mean that you have to wait to get your money. A delay may happen when market conditions mean it is difficult for the fund manager to cash in investments to pay out to investors. For example, a fund with investments in commercial properties may find they may take time to sell. Whilst waiting to complete on the sale of properties, the fund manager may suspend making payments to investors who want to cash in. The fund can only delay paying out if it is in the interests of all investors.
